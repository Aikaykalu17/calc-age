## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### What I learned

Working on this project, it was a really challenging and tough one. At first, I thought it was goin to be simple, but I was wrong. It was really difficult to try to calculate a user's age in years, months and days. I had to make a lot of research before I could figure it out. I learned how to dynamically add text context to spans or elemets using javaScript. I learned how to add an event listener to an SVG icon, and also the enter key. I learned a lot!! As the overview of the challenge states, working with dates can be very tricky. But I'm glad I was able to pull it off. I also tried to make it responsive on different screen sizes.
To reinforce knowledge and make the project a little bit nicer, I had to write some lines of code for the user's live location.

```html
<h1>All my span</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('Proud of all my JS code ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

I guess I just have to continue building projects.
